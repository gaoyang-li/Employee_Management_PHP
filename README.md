# Management_System

Kilburnazon Design Specification:
    Kilburnazon’s staff are organised into departments including Management, HR, Drivers and Packagers. Each of these departments has a name, number and an employee who manages it. We
should also note the numbers of employees in each department and the department’s head office
location.<br />
    Each employee in Kilburnazon has an employee number which stays with them for the duration of their employment. We must also know their name, home address, salary, date of birth and
national insurance number (NIN). Every employee is assigned to a single department and has a
manager they report to, the manager will be from the management department. Each employee
will also have an emergency contact on record, we need to know their name, relationship to the
employee and phone number.<br />
    Every company building is situated in one of the areas of the UK, each area has a unique
name. All drivers and packagers report to the warehouses in their area whereas managers and HR
staff work in a single office. Each warehouse is contained within a specific area, has a unique id,
location, size and purpose. The company has two main offices, one in Manchester and the other
in London, these are named after their location.<br />
    A manager may oversee the work of multiple employees from multiple departments. For drivers
we must also keep track of the number of hours a week they are working. The company owns lots
of vehicles each one has a unique ID, name and area it operates in. Routes for vehicles always
contain a starting and ending location with the possibility for multiple stops in the middle. Each
route has a unique name given to them (e.g. red-002). The time a vehicle arrives at each location
must also be. A driver will be assigned to a vehicle from their area each day and then allocated a
delivery route.<br />
    Every time a customer places an order we capture their full name, email address, postal location and the products that have been ordered. We then receive this information in their order
forms. Each order can contain multiple products with varying quantities. Each order also has an
id and purchase date.<br />
    We must keep track of our full product list at all times. Each product has a unique id, name,
description, price and quantity left in the warehouses.
    Finally, HR deal with any complaints received, these must all be logged with their unique
complaint number, date of the complaint, passenger complaints name and the reason for the
complaint. This complaint will then be allocated to a member of the HR team to deal with. <br />
